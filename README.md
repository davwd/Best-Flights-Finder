  <h1>Best Flight Finder</h1> 
  <br>
  <p>This C++ program utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm with a priority queue to efficiently search for the shortest path between two vertices within a directed graph. The algorithm was implemented in a graph in which the vertices are airports and the directed and weighted edges are flights between them. The edge weight in this case is a combination of the departure and arrival time for each flight: Earliest arrival == least weight. </p> 
  <br>

  <p> Warning:  This algorithm will not work for graphs with <b>loops</b>, <b>negative edges</b>, or <b>islanded vertices</b>.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Notes:  The code can be easily tweaked to change the data input format (like through cin user input). </p>
